## 🧠 1. Background and Overview

As a data analyst, I wanted to go beyond basic dashboards and build something that provides true business value. This project focuses on answering strategic questions such as:

- Which products and regions are performing best?
- What are our customer behavior trends?
- Where can we improve revenue and retention?

Using Power BI, DAX, and data storytelling techniques, I translated raw transactional data into insights that can drive product, marketing, and customer decisions.

## 💡 5. Business Recommendations

## ⚠️ Caveats and Assumptions

- **Churn** is inferred behaviorally as single-purchase customers with no follow-up transactions.
- **ROI** is measured via total revenue only; cost data was not available.
- **Retention** and customer loyalty were measured based on repeat transactions within the given dataset.
- Dataset is synthetic and reflects a simplified e-commerce scenario.
